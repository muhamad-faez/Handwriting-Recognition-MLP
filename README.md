# Handwriting Recognition MLP

This project aims to develop a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) for handwriting recognition and localization of handwritten characters in images.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- TorchMetrics
- TensorBoard
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

## Installation and Running the Project

1. Clone the repository:
```sh
        git clone https://github.com/muhamad-faez/Handwriting-Recognition-MLP.git
        cd Handwriting-Recognition-MLP
```

2. Install the required packages:
```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```    

3. Train and evaluate the model:
```sh
    python main.py
```  

4. View the results
   - Use TensorBoard to visualize training metrics.
   - Check the localized characters in Hello.jpg. git
